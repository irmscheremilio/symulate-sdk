// Configure SDK
configureSymulate({
  symulateApiKey: 'demo_key',
  generateMode: 'faker',
  fakerSeed: 12345,
  environment: 'development',
  cacheEnabled: true,
})

// Define schema
const ProductSchema = m.object({
  id: m.uuid(),
  name: m.commerce.productName(),
  price: m.commerce.price(),
  // ... more fields
})

// Define endpoint
const getProducts = defineEndpoint({
  path: '/api/products',
  method: 'GET',
  schema: ProductSchema,
  mock: { count: 12 },
})
```
